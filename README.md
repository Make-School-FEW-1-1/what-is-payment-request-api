# Payment Request API

## What is the Payment Request API?
The API was created by the W3C as a potential solution to standardizing payment flow.  The API allows merchants, web sites which sell a service or good, to utilize a single or variety of payment methods with ease and minimal integration.  Via the Payment Request API, the user agent, in this case a browser, will facilitate the payment flow between a merchant and user.
